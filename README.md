# SwiftUI niche pieces

SwiftUI niche pieces is a library that slightly extends the SwiftUI API in certain versions of SwiftUI, which can be a bit of an itch that "the next version has a solution" or "using UIKit would make it possible".

## What we can do now

- Automatically apply cursor control to Searchable modifiers in iOS15
- Enable Detent in iOS15 for SwiftUI half-modals, etc.

## Examples

Sample Code Here
